# Overview
The app I created can be used to get directions through a set of waypoints specified by the user with the shortest possible path through those points. On the home screen the user is presented with a form of 6 text fields. The user can fill out those feilds with their starting location, 4 destination waypoints, and an end location. Once the form is completely filled out the user can click the button 'calculate fastest route' which will open a new page of the app. At first there may be a loading icon, but then a button will appear on the screen, and when pressed will take the user to google maps where they will see the directions of the shortest route for the waypoints they specified.

My purpose for creating this app was mainly to learn how to use flutter for mobile app development.

# Development Environment
To develop this app I used Flutter and dart in the Android Studio IDE
# Useful Websites
* [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)

# Future Work
* Add the ability to specify a number of waypoints
* add the ability to use current location as start location
* Use an algorithim to make calculation times faster
